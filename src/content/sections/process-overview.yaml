  - title: 'Step Five: Selection Process'

      Each hiring committee will select the applicant(s) that best fits their 
      needs. If you are selected, you will be contacted by the STAR team who 
      will work with you to complete appropriate paperwork. While we would like 
      to provide everyone with a selection update, the volume of applicants may 
      prevent us from doing so.
