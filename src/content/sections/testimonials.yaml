      I accepted an offer to attend The University of Illinois
      Urbana-Champaign. I ended up receiving an academic achievement
      scholarship from UIUC. I couldn't have done it without RENCI's
      internship experience.

      Before my internship, I did not know/understand the effort that 
      went into project proposals and creating a DEI team. I have 
      thoroughly enjoyed all that I have been able to learn while 
      interning this semester.

      I had a great experience as the RENCI Communications Team 
      intern! I feel like I learned a lot in terms of public relations 
      tasks and written materials.

      The experience at RENCI is really great. I learned how to code 
      and manage projects professionally. My supervisor Yufeng is a 
      knowledgeable person and all my teammates are very helpful. The 
      weekly meeting really helped me to understand the whole project 
      and gave me a clear view of my current work.

      I learned more about the [Computer Science] and Data Science 
      field, especially how [Computer Science] can be related to many 
      other aspects of academia. Additionally, I learned that I don't 
      have to have a technical background to be in [Computer Science] 
      and how project management is a great way to contribute to the 
      team.
