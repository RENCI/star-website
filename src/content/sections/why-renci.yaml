      have real world impacts and include work to end the opioid crisis, 
      create better information sharing during pandemics, better 
      understand and model coastal hurricane impacts, provide more rapid 
      and effective treatment for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders,

      RENCI puts people first, promoting learning, personal growth, 
      collaboration, flexibility, and work/life balance, and these 
      priorities extend to STAR students as well. We boast a diverse staff 
      and leadership that genuinely care about, support, and celebrate 
      individual and team successes equally. As a STAR student, youâ€™ll find 
      that RENCI staff supports your professional goals, regardless of your 
      technical experience. We are proud to not only offer STARships within 
      our research teams, but we also provide opportunities within our 
      operational teams, such as Project Management, Communications, 
      Cyberinfrastructure Security, and more.
